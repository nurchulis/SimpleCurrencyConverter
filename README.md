SimpleCurrencyConverter
=======================

Convert between a few currencies and euros on your Android phone, as easily as possible. See the
[GitHub page](http://peruukki.github.io/SimpleCurrencyConverter/) for more details.

The code was originally written in Java but has now been converted to
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/android-overview.html). The Java code before the
conversion is still available in the [`java` branch](../../tree/java).

## Icons

This project uses the `swap horiz` icon from
[Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

## Currency rates

The currency rates are fetched from the
[Free Currency Converter API](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/).
